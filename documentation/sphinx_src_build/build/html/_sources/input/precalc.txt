   George, please improve!  My interpretations also need to be checked...

**PRECALC**
    Start pre-calculation block.  This chooses which weighting parameters
    to use in Monte Carlo calculation , in order to give minimum variance.
    This is an optional input block, and is not required if the default
    parameters are to be used, or are specified explicitly in the **CALC**
    input block.  Currently, only the **IMPORTANCE** parameter, the C
    **EXCITWEIGHTING** parameter, and the a & b optimal parameters are
    searched for simultaneously, optimised and parsed through the the
    main program.

[PreCalc options---see below.]

**ENDPRECALC**
    End the precalc input block.

PreCalc Options
---------------

.. note::
 George: 
 What on earth are the following:

 * A,B etc parameters.
 * XXX.  
 * U matrix.

**VERTEX** [**HDIAG** **RHODIAG**] [**SUM** **MC**]
    Similar to the methods section in the **CALC** block, specify the
    method to use at the next vertex level (the first entry is for the
    second vertex level) in searching for the best parameters, using the
    hamiltonian matrix diagonaltisation (**HDIAG**) or the :math:`\rho`
    matrix diagonalisation (**RHODIAG**). After this is specified, on
    the same line, specify whether to calculate the expected variance
    using the full sum at this vertex level (**SUM**), or using a Monte
    Carlo sum (**MC**).

    Currently, only the **HDIAG** routine works when performing a MC
    expected variance, though the diagonalisation of the `\rho` matrix
    now works with the full sum.

    For example::

         **VERTEX** **HDIAG** **SUM**
         XXX
         XXX
         **VERTEX** **HDIAG** **MC**
         XXX

    where XXX are the vertex options (see below).

    If no further options are specified for a given vertex level, the
    optimum values of all the **EXCITWEIGHTING** variables will be found,
    but not used in the main program.

**GRIDVAR** [A_ExcitFromStart] [A_ExcitFromEnd] [A_ExcitFromStep] [B_ExcitToStart] [B_ExcitToEnd] [B_ExcitToStep]
    Produce a 3D map of the variance landscape, but do not explicitly
    calculate the minimum. Vaules for the A parameter start, end, and
    step must be specified, followed by the same for the B parameter.

**LINEVAR** [G_VMC_PIStart] [G_VMC_PIEnd] [G_VMC_PIStep]
    Same as GRIDVAR, but produce a 1D line for one variable - currently
    only working for the **IMPORTANCE** parameter and the U-matrix element
    parameter. Shows change in expected variance over the designated range
    of values.

**MEMORISE**
    All the graphs, their excitation generators, weights, energies, and
    unbiased probabilities should be stored in the memory.  Speeds up
    the calculation of the variance by around twofold. However, this
    cannot be used for large systems.  ~31000 4v graphs, or 22000 3v
    graphs was the maximum for the nitrogen dimer with the VQZ basis .

    Currently only available for **MC** precalculations. If this is not
    set, then only the first node excitation generators are stored---there
    should be enough memory for this

**PREGRAPHEPSILON** [PREWEIGHTEPS]
    Default :math:`10^{-8}`.

    Gives the threshold above which the weight of a graph must be if
    they are to be included in the full precalc variance calculation. 
    
    If the graph weight is below the threshold, then the probability
    of obtaining the graph does not need to be calculated, and so
    the optimisation routine is faster (but less accurate) at higher
    thresholds.

**TOTALERROR** [Desired Error from main calculation]
    Calculates the required number of cycles so that the final
    error from the Monte Carlo calculation is equal to the error specified.  

    Only valid if the highest vertex level in the precalculation stage is the
    same as the highest vertex level in the main MC calculation, i.e. the 
    highest MC vertex level is independently optimised.

    The optimum vertex splitting is also calculated.

**TOLERANCE** [TOLERANCE]
    Default 0.1.

    The fractional precision to which the optimum parameter is obtained,
    using the minimisation method. 

**TRUECYCLES** [No.of cycles]
    Specify the total number of MC cycles that we want to use in the
    main calculation.  The precalculation stage will then automatically
    split the cycles between the vertex levels in the main calculation,
    according to how the use statements indicate the parameters are to
    be split.

    The cycles are then split so to best minimise the overall variance
    of the run, assuming that the variance of the whole run is simply
    the sum of the variances of the individual vertex results.

Vertex options
--------------

For the specified vertex level:

**CYCLES** [nCYCLES]
    Specify the number of graphs generated in the MC algorithm 
    for each expected variance calculation in the parameter minimisation algorithm.

    Applies only to a vertex level which evaluates the expected variance
    using the MC algorithm in the **VERTEX** line.  

**NONE**
    Perform no calculations or optimisations. 

**UEPSILON** [UEPSILON]
    Default UEPSILON is 0.

    Find the  optimum C **EXCITWEIGHTING** coefficient and pass through to the main program,
    unless setting C to be zero changes the expected variance by an amount less
    than UEPSILON, in which case C is set to be zero.

    The calculation of the U matrix elements can be time-consuming
    in a real MC simulation, yet can have a negligible effect on the 
    final result.  In these cases, setting the C coefficient to be zero 
    makes the full MC simulation much faster.
    
    With the the default value of UEPSILON, the optimum value of C will
    always be used in the main program.

**FINDC**
    Find the optimum C **EXCITWEIGHTING** parameter.
    
    The C **EXCITWEIGHTING** parameter. will only be found if this
    flag is set, or if a **UEPSILON** is set.   
    
    By default, the optimisation algoritm will only seek to find the
    values which give the minimum expected variance by varying the A and
    B **EXCITWEIGHTING** parameters, (or the parameters in the weighting
    scheme specified).

**FINDD**
    Find the optimum D **EXCITWEIGHTING** parameter for this vertex
    level (g_VMC_ExcitToWeight2).

**USED**
    Pass the optimum D **EXCITWEIGHTING** parameter found at this vertex level
    through to the main calculation.

**FINDIMPORT**
    Run the optimisation algorithm for the IMPORTANCE
    parameter.  
    
    The optimised value will be found printed out,
    but will not be passed through to the main calculation.

    Can only be set for vertex levels of three or higher for
    obvious reasons.

.. note::
 And the obvious reasons are?

**USEIMPORT**
    Find the optimal **IMPORTANCE** parameter, and use in the main
    calculation.

    As for **FINDIMPORT**, can only be set for vertex levels of three
    or higher.

**USE** [MC_VERTEX_LEVEL_1] [MC_VERTEX_LEVEL_2] ...
    Use in the main calculation the parameters calculated from the specified precalc
    vertex levels, rather than any other, are to be passed through and
    used in the main program when performing a MC at one of the vertex
    levels specified. Any given vertex level can only be specified once
    in all the **USE** statements.  
    
    Vertex levels in the main calculation which are not specified in one of 
    the precalc **USE** statements, will
    use the parameters which are given in the **CALC** block of
    the input file.  
    
    A **USE** statement on its own will only calculate the
    A and B **EXCITWEIGHTING** parameters (or any of the other weighting
    scheme parameters specified) and use them for all MC vertex levels
    in the main calculation, unless **FINDC** or **UEPSILON** is specified, 
    in which case for the C parameter to also be used.

.. note::
  This is somewhat confusing.  How does it fit in with USEIMPORT etc.?
