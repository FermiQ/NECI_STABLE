Compilation
-----------

To compile NECI run

    $ ./tools/mkconfig.py platform
    $ make

The platform is a filename in the config directory.  The mkconfig.py script
has some useful options.  Run

    $ ./tools/mkconfig.py --help

to see information on them.

The objects are compiled to dest/platform/optimised/real (or complex, for
compiling the complex version for libraries).  The resultant executable,
neci.platform.optimised.x, is placed in the exe directory.

If the debug flag [-g] is given to mkconfig.py, then the debug configuration is used and 
the filenames and paths contain debug rather than optimised.

For convenience, bin/neci.x is a symbolic link to the most recently compiled
executable.
