The following files are based on CPMD and need to be stripped from the
codebase.  These are just the files in NECI and CPMD which have a common name.

We were bad
===========

frsblk.F
    I know Ali claims it's different from CPMD's version, but do a diff and decide for yourself...
irat.inc
    We should be able to replace this pretty easily.  Thoughts as to best approach?
util.F
    Someone needs to spend some time with coffee, terminal and figure it out.
mkconfig.sh
    We should write our own.  What functionality do we want to keep/have in addition?

Unrelated files
===============

rhoofr.F
    Appears to be completely unrelated to CPMD's rhoofr.F.

Memory routines
===============

These are ready to be removed as and when we remove all crap Cray pointers, or
we could just write a wrapper for LogMem{A,Dea}lloc.  JSS would much rather switch
entirely to allocatable arrays though.

freem.F
memc.inc
memory.F

Additional routines
===================

SORT      (from Numerical Recipes though) 
SORT2     (from Numerical Recipes though)
SORT2I    (from Numerical Recipes though)
   Numerical recipes worries me: it might create some licencing problems in the near future.  Can someone check?  I've read something on this in the past, but can't remember the exact details.

GAMMLN
   Only used in generating factorials, which in turn is only used in two places.  Should be trivial to remove.

DSCAL     (from blas though!)
ZCOPY     (from blas though!)
   JSS: should remove the blas_tuned_NECSX file from the source anyway?
