The following files are based on CPMD and need to be stripped from the
codebase.

General
=======

frsblk.F
    I know Ali claims it's different from CPMD's version, but do a diff and decide for yourself...
    (Routines in frsblk have been prepended with NECI_ to avoid nameclashes.)
irat.inc
    We should be able to replace this pretty easily.  Thoughts as to best approach?
mkconfig.sh
    We should write our own.  What functionality do we want to keep/have in addition?

Memory routines
===============

These are ready to be removed when we remove all crap Cray pointers. JSS would much rather switch
entirely to allocatable arrays though.

freem.F
memc.inc
memory.F
