The following files are based on CPMD and need to be stripped from the codebase.  These are just the files in NECI and CPMD which have a common name.  There may be functions in common too. AJWT

We were bad
===========

frsblk.F
irat.inc
timer.F
util.F

Unrelated files?
================

rhoofr.F ! Appears to be completely unrelated to CPMD's rhoofr.F.

Memory routines
===============

These are ready to be removed as and when we remove all crap pointers.
(Or we could just write a wrapper for LogMem{A,Dea}lloc.)

freem.F
memc.inc
memory.F

Additional routines
===================

DSCAL     (from blas though!)
GAMMLN
SORT      (from Numerical Recipes though) 
SORT2     (from Numerical Recipes though)
SORT2I    (from Numerical Recipes though)
ZCOPY     (from blas though!)

So really we only need to worry about GAMMLN in addition to the above files.
