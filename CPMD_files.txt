The following files are based on CPMD and need to be stripped from the codebase.  These are just the files in NECI and CPMD which have a common name.  There may be functions in common too. AJWT

We were bad
===========

envir.F
envj.inc
frsblk.F
irat.inc
stopgm.F
time*.F
util.F

Unrelated files?
================

rhoofr.F ! Appears to be completely unrelated to CPMD's rhoofr.F.
xcener.F ! Only needed for XCENERGY_DENSITY, which is currently commented out.  Appears to have little (if anything) to do with CPMD's version. (JSS)

Memory routines
===============

These are ready to be removed as and when we remove all crap pointers.
(Or we could just write a wrapper for LogMem{A,Dea}lloc.)

freem.F
memc.inc
memory.F
prmem.F
