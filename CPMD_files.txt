The following files are based on CPMD and need to be stripped from the codebase.  These are just the files in NECI and CPMD which have a common name.  There may be functions in common too. AJWT

envir.F
envj.inc
freem.F
frsblk.F
get_addr.F ! Just a wrapper for LOC.  We don't use the special case machine, so can replace all get_addr with loc.
irat.inc
memc.inc
memory.F
prmem.F
rhoofr.F ! Appears to be completely unrelated to CPMD's rhoofr.F.
stopgm.F
time*.F
util.F
xcener.F ! Only needed for XCENERGY_DENSITY, which is currently commented out.  Appears to have little (if anything) to do with CPMD's version. (JSS)
