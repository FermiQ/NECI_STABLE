Documentation
=============

* Document existing options which are not documented (they're listed in the input/overview.rst file).
* Review and clarify existing documentation for the input options (as noted in the documentation).
* Expand the theory section.
* Example input files.

Platforms
=========

* ifort, serial, 32-bit.
* ifort, parallel (MPI).

Testing
=======

* Fill in test_notes to give information regarding what part of the code each test tests.
* Clean-up tests: improve coverage by making the tests more varied.
* Start nightly tests in parallel.
* Make nightly test directories writeable by the group, so anyone can produce new benchmarks, rather than just JSS.
* Ability to run test suite over, e.g. 4 cores. (This might not be so quick.)

Workflow
========

* git repository/repositories.
* python interface/job manager (not so short!).
