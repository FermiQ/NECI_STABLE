Brillouin theorem in use for calculation of projected energy.
 Calculating approximate pDoubles for use with excitation generator by looking a excitations from reference.
 Since we are using a momentum-space hubbard model/UEG, only double excitaitons                           are connected and will be generated.
 BACK-SPAWNING method in use! 
 For non-initiators we only pick electrons from the virtual
  orbitals of the reference determinant!
  so non-initiators only lower or keep the excitation level constant!
