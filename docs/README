NECI documentation
==================

The main NECI documentation is written in reStructured Text
(http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and is converted to html and pdf
formats using the sphinx tool (http://sphinx.pocoo.org).

Layout
------

development_notes
    Short (possibly not helpful, often legacy) notes documenting parts of
    neci.
neci
    Main neci documentation directory, largely focussing on user documentation.
    The contents of the documentation files are (hopefully!) obvious from the
    filenames.

    Contains the following subdirectories:

        neci/input
           Documentation detailing input options.
        neci/output
            Documentation detailing the output from neci (caution: outdated).
        neci/theory
            Documentation detailing some of the theory behind neci (caution: outdated).
        neci/example_inputs
            Files containing example input files (caution: outdated).  More example
            input files can be found in the test suite.

neci.html
    Symbolic link to the directory containing the html version of the
    documentation.  Open neci.html/index.html to start.
neci.pdf
    Symbolic link to the pdf version of the documentation.
.sphinx
    Directory containing the sphinx configuration files and build output.

Adding documentation
--------------------

Documentation is written in reStructured Text.  Good tutorials are:

* docutils guide: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html.
* matplotlib example documentation: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/sampledoc/.
* sphinx documentation: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html.

Maths can be written using LaTeX commands using the math directive.
Some additional LaTeX commands are already defined and new ones can
be added by extending the LaTeX preamble given in .sphinx/conf.py in the
latex_preamble variable.

Compiling documentation
-----------------------

Sphinx (>=0.6.3) is required in order to compile the documentation into html
and pdf output.  Installation instructions for sphinx are given on the project
website (http://sphinx.pocoo.org) and packages are available in the
repositories of many Linux distributions.

Assuming sphinx is installed, then the html and pdf output can be produced by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    make html pdf
