The following files are based on those in CPMD and need to be stripped from the
codebase.

General
=======

frsblk.F
    Ali wrote this in CPMD anyway, so it's ok...
    (Routines in frsblk have been prepended with NECI_ to avoid nameclashes.)

Memory routines
===============

These are ready to be removed when we remove all crap Cray pointers. JSS would much rather switch
entirely to allocatable arrays though.

freem.F
memory_data.F90 (was memc.inc)
memory.F
