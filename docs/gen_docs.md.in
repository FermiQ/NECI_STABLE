#Summary

This is NECI,
a state-of-the-art implementation of the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) algorithm,
a method based on a stochastic application of the Hamiltonian matrix on a sparse sampling of the wave function.
The program utilizes a
very powerful parallelization and scales efficiently to more than 24 000 central processing unit cores.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://www2.fkf.mpg.de/alavi/neci/master/index.html).

## Compilation

To compile the code, clone the repository (now referred to as `source_directory`)
and create a `build_directory` outside the `source_directory`.

Then you can type
```bash
cd ${build_directory}
cmake ${source_directory}
make -j
```
and are ready to go.
`cmake` will try to find all dependencies and fails if it cannot.

For detailed compilation and run options, please see the user documentation.


## Interfaces

Since NECI is mainly a program to solve the CI-problem
and only depends on the 1- and 2-electronic integrals.
Other code is required to compute these integrals and perform
other optimization tasks (like SCF orbital rotations).

So far it has been interfaced to
[OpenMolcas](https://molcas.gitlab.io/OpenMolcas/sphinx/users.guide/programs/rasscf.html#stochastic-casscf-method),
[Molpro](https://www.molpro.net/),
[PySCF](https://pyscf.org/), and [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/).
