DETS
----

DETS contains a list of determinants when they are enumerated.  This consists of two columns::

    Determinant   Symmetry

where: 

    Determinant contains an ordered list of NEL numbers, separated by commas,
    surrounded by parentheses:  e.g. (    1,    2,   13,   14,).

    Symmetry varies with the system type and is the internal symmetry label of the
    determinant.  It is either an integer or a propogation vector which corresponds
    to an irreducible representation of an Abelian group.
