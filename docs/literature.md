[^1]: `ssh-keygen` can also generate DSA keys. Some ssh clients and
servers will reject DSA keys longer than 1024 bits, and 1024 bits is
currently on the margin of being crackable. As such 2048 bit RSA keys
are preferred. Top secret this code is. Probably. Apart from the master
branch which hosted for all on github. And in molpro. And anyone that
wants it obviously.
