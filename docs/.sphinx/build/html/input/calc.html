**SINGLE**
    MC is performed at a single vertex level using a composite
    1-vertex graph containing a full sum previously performed.

**BIAS**
    is used to choose whether a step selects a composite
    (all lower levels) or a normal (this level) graph.  Stochastic
    time MC is performed. This can only be specified in the
    **METHODS** section, and only at the last vertex level.
    Uses **EXCITWEIGHTING** for excitation generation weighting
    and **IMPORTANCE** for graph generation weighting

**MULTI**
    MC is performed at a multiple vertex levels, but still
    using a composite 1-vertex graph containing a full sum
    previously performed. MULTI should be specified in all the
    (contiguous) vertex levels to be included (not composited)
    in the MC.  **BIAS** is used to choose whether a step
    selects a composite (all lower levels) or a normal (the
    **MULTI** levels) graph.  **MULTIMCWEIGHT** is specified
    for each **MULTI** level, and gives a relative weighting
    of selecting the vertex level graphs once a non-composite
    graph is chosen.  Stochastic time MC is performed.
    This can only be specified in the **METHODS** section.
    Once **MULTI** has been specified, it must be specified
    on all subsequent vertex levels in a **METHODS** section.
    Uses **EXCITWEIGHTING** for excitation generation weighting
    and **IMPORTANCE** for graph generation weighting

**FULL**
    Does  MC at all levels using BIAS to bias the levels,
    **EXCITWEIGHTING** for excitation generation, and
    **IMPORTANCE** to for graph generation weighting.  This is
    only available *WITHOUT* a **METHODS** section. If **HDIAG**
    is specified, the H-diagonalizing routine is used, otherwise,

hamiltonian matrix elements are zero. Instead, their diagonals are modified
to change the on-site death rate. Particles now have a fixed (positive)
sign which cannot be changed and so no annihilation occurs.  Results were

</dd>
<dt><strong>MEMORYFACANNIHIL</strong> [MemoryFacAnnihil]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default 10.D0</p>
<p class="last">MemoryFacAnnihil is a parallel FCIMC option - it is the factor by which space will be
made available for annihilation arrays compared to InitWalkers. This generally will need to be
larger than memoryfacpart, because the parallel annihilation may not be exactly load-balanced because of
non-uniformity in the wavevector and the hashing algorithm. This will tend to want to be larger
when it is running on more processors.</p>

<dt><strong>MEMORYFACSPAWN</strong> [MemoryFacSpawn]</dt>

</dd>
<dt><strong>ANNIHILATEONPROCS</strong></dt>

<p class="last">A Parallel FCIMC option. With this, particles are annihilated separately on each node.
This should mean less annihilation occurs, but it is effectivly running nProcessor
separate simulations. If there are enough particles, then this should be sufficient.
Less memory is required, since no hashes need to be stored. Also, no communication is
needed, so the routine should scale better as the number of walkers grows.</p>

<dt><strong>ROTOANNIHILATION</strong></dt>

<p class="last">A parallel FCIMC option which is a different - and hopefully better scaling - algorithm.
This is substantially different to previously. It should involve much less memory.
<strong>MEMORYFACANNIHIL</strong> is no longer needed (<strong>MEMORYFACPART</strong> still is), and you will need
to specify a <strong>MEMORYFACSPAWN</strong> since newly spawned walkers are held on a different array each iteration.
Since the newly-spawned particles are annihilated initially among themselves, you can still

<dt><strong>FIXSHELLSHIFT</strong> [ShellFix] [FixShift]</dt>

but may be of use in equilibration steps to maintain particle density at
low excitations, before writing out the data and letting the shift change.</p>

than fixing the shift based on an excitation level, it is now fixed according to the
Kii value. Determinants lower in energy than FixedKiiCutoff will have their shifts
fixed to the value given.</blockquote>

<dd><p class="first">Default 0 0 0.D0</p>
<p class="last">A third fixed shift approximation method for FCIMC in parallel.  In this option, an active
space is chosen containing a number of highest occupied spin orbitals (OccCASorbs) and a
number of lowest unoccupied spin orbitals (VirtCASorbs).  The shift is then fixed (at FixShift)
for determinants with excitations within this space only.  I.e. determinants for which the spin
orbitals lower in energy than the active space are completely occupied and those higher in
energy are completely unoccupied.</p>

<dt><strong>SINGLESBIAS</strong> [SinglesBias]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default 1.D0</p>
<p class="last">This represents the factor to which singles are biased towards over double excitations from a determinant.
This works with the NONUNIFORMRANDEXCITS excitation generators for FCIMC code. Normally, the
pDoubles is given by the number of doubles divided by the total excitations from HF. Now,
the number of singles in the total excitations term is multiplied by SinglesBias. Alternatively,
SinglesBias can be set to less than 1 to bias towards doubles.</p>

<dt><strong>FINDGROUNDDET</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default=.false.</p>
<p class="last">A parallel FCIMC option. If this is on, then if a determinant is found with an energy lower

reference changed to the new determinant. For a HF basis, this cannot happen, but with
rotated orbital may be important.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>DEFINEDET</strong> [DefDet(NEl)]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default=.false.</p>
<p class="last">A parallel FCIMC option.  This allows the reference determinant to be chosen based on that specified in

the orbitals.  The determinant is specified by a series of NEl integers (separated by spaces)
which represent the occupied spin orbitals.</p>

<dt><strong>DIRECTANNIHILATION</strong></dt>

<p class="last">A parallel FCIMC option. This annihilation algorithm has elements in common with rotoannihilation

respect to the number of processors. There are no explicit loops over processors, and newly-spawned
particles are sent directly to their respective processors.</p>

<dt><strong>ANNIHILATDISTANCE</strong> [Lambda]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default=0.D0</p>
<p class="last">A serial FCIMC option. Here, walkers i and j have the chance to annihilate each other
as long as they are on connected determinants. They will annihilate with probability
given by -Lambda*Hij*(Si*Sj). This is hoped to increase annihilation and allow fewer
particles to be needed to sample the space correctly. When Lambda=0.D0, it should be
equivalent to the original annihilation algorithm. Warning - this is much slower than
normal annihilation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ANNIHILATERANGE</strong> [<strong>OFF</strong>]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default=.true.</p>
<p class="last">A parallel FCIMC option. This is a slightly different annihilation algorithm, where only
one sort of the full set of particles is needed. This should greatly reduce the time needed
for annihilation of large numbers of particles. However, the load-balancing across processors
may not be so good. This option is now on by default and can only be switched off via the input
file by specifying <strong>OFF</strong> after the keyword.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>LOCALANNIHIL</strong> [Lambda]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A parallel FCIMC option. An additional diagonal death rate is included at the annihilation
stage for particles which are only singly occupied. The probability of death is given by
Tau*EXP(-Lambda*ExcitDensity) where ExcitDensity is the approximate density of particles in
the excitation level of the particle. This should raise death through this local annihilation,
and hence keep the shift at a more resonable value in the undersampled regime. This will
hopefully mean that a more accurate energy value can be obtained by removing the random
killing of particles which arises from such a low shift value.</p>
<p>This is now commented out in the code</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>UNBIASPGENINPROJE</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default false</p>
<p class="last">An FCIMC serial option. Here, the acceptance probabilities are not unbiased for
the probability of generating the excitation. Instead, the unbiasing occurs when the
walker contributes to the energy estimator. This should reduce the variance for the
energy estimator.</p>

<dt><strong>GLOBALSHIFT</strong> <strong>OFF</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default true</p>
<p>This option can only be turned off by specifying <strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p class="last">A parallel FCIMC option. It is generally recommended to have this option on. This will
calculate the growth rate of the system as a simple ratio of the total walkers on all processors
before and after update cycle, rather than a weighted average. This however is incompatable with culling, and so
is removed for update cycles with this in. This should be more stable than the
default version and give a more reliable shift estimator for large systems.</p>

<dt><strong>MAGNETIZE</strong> [NoMagDets] [BField]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default false</p>
<p class="last">This is a parallel FCIMC option. It chooses the largest weighted MP1 components and records their
sign. If then a particle occupies this determinant and is of the opposite sign, it energy,

This is a parallel FCIMC option, which means that the diagonal hamiltonian matrix
element for each particle is calculated on the fly, rather than stored with the

<dt><strong>REGENEXCITGENS</strong></dt>

That is, spawning onto minor determinants is allowed, but these walkers are only allowed

their occupations from the previous calculation (in GUIDINGFUNC) relative to the HF determinant.
The function of this guiding function is then to sit in the background of a calculation, able to annihilate
walkers, but unable to itself spawn of have its walkers die.
Assuming the GUIDINGFUNC from the previous calculation has the correct nodal structure, this guiding function

<dt><strong>TRUNCINITIATOR</strong></dt>
<dd>This is a parallel FCIMC option.  The keyword requires an initiator space to first be defined (usually
via <strong>TRUNCATECAS</strong>, but could be by <strong>EXCITE</strong>).
This is then a variation on a kind of CAS-star approach.  Spawning is subject to the contraint
that walkers spawned from determinants outside the active space only live if they are being spawned onto
determinants that are already occupied.  If walkers spawned on a new determinant have non-initiator parents,
these spawns are &#8216;aborted&#8217;.  A special case is if in the same iteration walkers are spawned on a new
determinant both from inside and outside the active space - in this case we treat the active space to have
spawned a second earlier, the determinant is then treated as occupied and the non-active space walkers are
allowed to live (providing they are the same sign of course).
NOTE: This is currently only possible using <strong>DIRECTANNIHILATION</strong>.</dd>
<dt><strong>DELAYTRUNCINITIATOR</strong> [IterTruncInit]</dt>
<dd>This goes with the above.  This allows us to first start with an active space only calculation and then at some
iteration (given by IterTruncInit), to expand to the <strong>TRUNCINITIATOR</strong> method.  The beginning of the
<strong>TRUNCINITIATOR</strong> method may also be started dynamically by putting TRUNCINITIATOR in the CHANGEVARS file.
At the moment, when this happens, tau is also reduced by a factor of 10.  This should maybe be played with at
some stage though.</dd>
<dt><strong>KEEPDOUBSPAWNS</strong></dt>
<dd>This keyword goes along with the above <strong>TRUNCINITIATOR</strong>.  This is an extra exception which means that if
two determinant spawn on the same determinant with the same sign, they are allowed to live no matter where they
came from.  This is different from the original case where if both of these had come from non-initiator
determinants, they would have both been killed.</dd>
<dt><strong>ADDTOINITIATOR</strong> [InitiatorWalkerNo]</dt>
<dd>This is again an addition to the above few options.  In this case, if a determinant outside the initiator space
builds up a significant population (greater than InitiatorWalkerNo), it is treated as being in the initiator
space and may spawn on occupied or unoccupied determinants as it likes.  This is reassessed at each iteration
however, so determinant may move in and out of the initiator space as the populations vary.</dd>
<dt><strong>INCLDOUBSINITIATOR</strong></dt>
<dd>This keyword also goes with <strong>TRUNCINITIATOR</strong>, and is a parallel FCIMC option.  When it is present, all doubly
excited determinants are included in the initiator space, and are allowed to spawn as usual.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following option are only available in <strong>MCSTAR</strong> calculations:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>BINCANCEL</strong></dt>
<dd>This is a seperate method to cancel down to find the residual
walkers from a list, involving binning the walkers into their
determinants. This has to refer to the whole space, and so is
much slower.  See also the <strong>WAVEVECTORPRINT</strong> and <strong>POPSFILE</strong>
options in the <strong>LOGGING</strong> block.</dd>
<dt><strong>STARORBS</strong> [iStarOrbs] [<strong>NORETURN</strong> | <strong>ALLSPAWNSTARDETS</strong>]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Default=.false. , NORETURN = OFF</p>
<p class="last">A parallel FCIMC option. Star orbs means that determinants which
contain these orbitals can only be spawned at from the HF determinant,
and conversly, can only spawn back at the HF determinant. iStarOrbs is
the integer variable which decides how many orbitals are in this high-
energy space, and take the iStarOrbs number of highest energy orbitals
to construct it. <strong>NORETURN</strong> is an optional keyword specifier. If it
is specified, then any excitations from the HF to these high-energy
determinants (doubles) are left to die and cannot respawn back to the
HF determinant. <strong>ALLSPAWNSTARDETS</strong> is another optional keyword, which
means that all particles can spawn at determinants with star orbitals, and
once there, annihilation can occur. However, they cannot respawn anywhere
else and are left there to die.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EXCITETRUNCSING</strong> [iHightExcitsSing]</dt>

<p class="last">This is a parallel FCIMC option, where excitations between determinants where

expand to the full space after iteration iFullSpaceIter.
Hopefully expanding the space in this way will allow quicker
convergence, without needing to do this dynamically through the use of CHANGEVARS which may be difficult for
long/queued jobs.</p>

<dd><blockquote class="first">
When choosing the electron to excite, use a a increasing polynomial
up to the chemical potential and a decaying polynomial for spin orbitals
above the chemical potential, in order to encourage mixing of
the configurations around the HF state. Contains three adjustable
parameters and testing needs to be done to see if this is
beneficial. Expected to make more of a difference as the vertex
level increases.</blockquote>

<p class="last">What is the actual weighting form of <strong>CHEMPOT-TWOFROM</strong>?</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt><strong>UFORM-POWER</strong></dt>
<dd>New power form for the U-matrix element weighting using the
appropriate <strong>EXCITWEIGHT</strong> element, which is believed to be
better. This uses the form <img class="math" src="../_images/math/1a7f95be2993b4bacddf19a33ab2c1fbec963c2c.png" alt="W=1+|U|^{\text{EXCITWEIGHT}}"/>, rather than the
exponential form.</dd>
<dt><strong>STEPEXCITWEIGHTING</strong> [g_VMC_ExcitWeights(1) g_VMC_ExcitWeights(2) G_VMC_EXCITWEIGHT]</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This excitation weighting consists of a step function between the HF virtual and occupied electon manifold (i.e. step is at the chemical potential)
When choosing an electron to move, the weight for selecting the electron is increased by 1 if the electron oribital has energy above the chemical potential
and by g_VMC_ExcitWeights(1,1) if below. This occurs for both electrons. When choosing where to excite to, the situation is reversed, and the weight of selecting the
unoccupied orbital is increased by 1 if the orbital is a hole in the occupied manifold and g_VMC_ExcitWeights(2,1) if a virtual orbital in the occupied manifold.
Bear in mind that the parameters are NOT probabilities. If we are at a higher excitation level w.r.t. HF, then more electrons will be in the virtual manifold,
which will alter the normalisation, and mean that when selecting electrons to excite, there will be an increasingly small probability of selecting them from the
occupied manifold. The opposite is true when choosing where to put them.</p>
<p>Simply put, if the parameters are both &lt; 1, then the biasing will preferentially generate excitations which reduce the excitation level.</p>
<p class="last">U-weighting is the third parameter as before.</p>
