  abstract = {The Schrödinger eigenvalue problem is solved with the imaginary time propagation technique. The separability of the Hamiltonian makes the problem suitable for the application of splitting methods. High order fractional time steps of order greater than two necessarily have negative steps and can not be used for this class of diffusive problems. However, there exist methods which use fractional complex time steps with positive real parts which can be used with only a moderate increase in the computational cost. We analyze the performance of this class of schemes and propose new methods which outperform the existing ones in most cases. On the other hand, if the gradient of the potential is available, methods up to fourth order with real and positive coefficients exist. We also explore this case and propose new methods as well as sixth-order methods with complex coefficients. In particular, highly optimized sixth-order schemes for near integrable systems using positive real part complex coefficients with and without modified potentials are presented. A time-stepping variable order algorithm is proposed and numerical results show the enhanced efficiency of the new methods.},

  abstract = {For many decades, quantum chemical method development has been dominated by algorithms which involve increasingly complex series of tensor contractions over one-electron orbital spaces. Procedures for their derivation and implementation have evolved to require the minimum amount of logic and rely heavily on computationally efficient library-based matrix algebra and optimized paging schemes. In this regard, the recent development of exact stochastic quantum chemical algorithms to reduce computational scaling and memory overhead requires a contrasting algorithmic philosophy, but one which when implemented efficiently can often achieve higher accuracy/cost ratios with small random errors. Additionally, they can exploit the continuing trend for massive parallelization which hinders the progress of deterministic high-level quantum chemical algorithms. In the Quantum Monte Carlo community, stochastic algorithms are ubiquitous but the discrete Fock space of quantum chemical methods is often unfamiliar, and the methods introduce new concepts required for algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we explore these concepts and detail an algorithm used for Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which is implemented and available in MOLPRO and as a standalone code, and is designed for high-level parallelism and linear-scaling with walker number. Many of the algorithms are also in use in, or can be transferred to, other stochastic quantum chemical methods and implementations. We apply these algorithms to the strongly correlated Chromium dimer, to demonstrate their efficiency and parallelism.},

As these FCIQMC values have been shown to converge onto FCI results, the i-FCIQMC method allows similar accuracy to be achieved while significantly reducing the scaling with the size of the Slater determinant space. The i-FCIQMC electron affinities of the Z ⩽ 11 atoms in the aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets are presented here.

Since the only remaining source of error is basis set incompleteness, we have investigated using CCSD(T)-F12 contributions to correct the i-FCIQMC results. By doing so, much faster convergence with respect to basis set size may be achieved for both the electron affinities and the FCIQMC ionization potentials presented in a previous paper.

  abstract = {The limited precision of floating point arithmetic can lead to the qualitative and even catastrophic failure of quantum chemical algorithms, especially when high accuracy solutions are sought. For example, numerical errors accumulated while solving for determinantal configuration interaction wave functions via Davidson diagonalization may lead to spin contamination in the trial subspace. This spin contamination may cause the procedure to converge to roots with undesired ⟨Ŝ2⟩, wasting computer time in the best case and leading to incorrect conclusions in the worst. In hopes of finding a suitable remedy, we investigate five purification schemes for ensuring that the eigenvectors have the desired ⟨Ŝ2⟩. These schemes are based on projection, penalty, and iterative approaches. All of these schemes rely on a direct, graphics processing unit-accelerated algorithm for calculating the S2c matrix-vector product. We assess the computational cost and convergence behavior of these methods by application to several benchmark systems and find that the first-order spin penalty method is the optimal choice, though first-order and Löwdin projection approaches also provide fast convergence to the desired spin state. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of these approaches, we computed the lowest several excited states of an open-shell silver cluster (Ag19) using the state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field method, where spin purification was required to ensure spin stability of the CI vector coefficients. Several low-lying states with significant multiply excited character are predicted, suggesting the value of a multireference approach for modeling plasmonic nanomaterials.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper, we proposed the adaptive shift method for correcting undersampling bias of the initiator-full configuration interaction (FCI) quantum Monte Carlo. The method allows faster convergence with the number of walkers to the FCI limit than the normal initiator method, particularly for large systems. However, in its application to some systems, mostly strongly correlated molecules, the method is prone to overshooting the FCI energy at intermediate walker numbers, with convergence to the FCI limit from below. In this paper, we present a solution to the overshooting problem in such systems, as well as further accelerating convergence to the FCI energy. This is achieved by offsetting the reference energy to a value typically below the Hartree–Fock energy but above the exact energy. This offsetting procedure does not change the exactness property of the algorithm, namely, convergence to the exact FCI solution in the large-walker limit, but at its optimal value, it greatly accelerates convergence. There is no overhead cost associated with this offsetting procedure and is therefore a pure and substantial computational gain. We illustrate the behavior of this offset adaptive shift method by applying it to the N2 molecule, the ozone molecule at three different geometries (an equilibrium open minimum, a hypothetical ring minimum, and a transition state) in three basis sets (cc-pVXZ, X = D, T, Q), and the chromium dimer in the cc-pVDZ basis set, correlating 28 electrons in 76 orbitals. We show that in most cases, the offset adaptive shift method converges much faster than both the normal initiator method and the original adaptive shift method.},

The algorithm efficiently samples states with probability approximately proportional to an arbitrary function of the second-quantized Hamiltonian matrix element connecting the sampled state to the current state. We apply the new sampling algorithm to the recently developed semistochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (S-FCIQMC) method, a semistochastic implementation of the power method for projecting out the ground state energy in a basis of Slater determinants. Our new sampling method requires modest additional computational time and memory compared to uniform sampling but results in newly spawned weights that are approximately of the same magnitude, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of projection. A comparison in efficiency between our sampling algorithm and uniform sampling is performed on the all-electron nitrogen dimer at equilibrium in Dunning’s cc-pVXZ basis sets with X ∈ \{D, T, Q, 5\}, demonstrating a large gain in efficiency that increases with basis set size. In addition, a comparison in efficiency is performed on three all-electron first-row dimers, B2, N2, and F2, in a cc-pVQZ basis, demonstrating that the gain in efficiency compared to uniform sampling also increases dramatically with the number of electrons.},

  abstract = {Polynuclear transition-metal (PNTM) clusters, ubiquitous in biological systems, owe their catalytic activity to the presence of a large manifold of low-lying spin states, and a number of stable oxidation states. The ab initio description of such systems - starting from the electronic Schrodinger equation - represents one of the greatest challenges of modern quantum chemistry, requiring highly multiconfigurational treatments. We propose a theoretical framework of simple and physically motivated molecular-orbital transformations that enable the resolution and characterization of targeted electronic wave functions with ease. This paradigm allows us to unravel the complicated electronic correlations in PNTM clusters. We apply it to two super-oxidized iron-sulfur cubane [Fe4S4] structures, and accurately characterize their singlet ground and low-lying excited states. Through direct access to their wave functions, we identify the important correlation mechanisms and their interplay with the geometrical distortions observed in these clusters. Our results unambiguously reveal a hidden magnetic order in the manifold of singlet states. Namely, that in all low-energy singlet states of the two compounds, well-defined spin structures are formed within two pairs of magnetic sites. For instance, in the ground state of one compound two iron sites of local S = 5/2 spins are strongly ferromagnetically correlated to form two S = 5 intermediate pair states; two such pairs are then anti-ferromagnetically coupled to yield an overall singlet. In the five excited singlets, the spin of these hidden pair-states is reduced in steps to zero. We find that the ab initio results for these compounds can be mapped with high fidelity onto a four-site Heisenberg–Dirac–van Vleck Hamiltonian with two anti-ferromagnetic coupling constants. Thus, the complexes are intrinsically frustrated anti-ferromagnets, and the obtained spin structures, together with the geometrical distortions represent two possible ways to release spin frustration. The geometrical distortions may be seen as the result of a spin-driven Jahn-Teller distortion, that lifts the electronic ground state degeneracies. Our paradigm provides a simple yet rigorous wave function-based route to uncover the electronic structure of PNTM clusters, and may be applied to a wide variety of such clusters.},

  abstract = {High-quality excitation generators are crucial to the effectiveness of coupled cluster Monte Carlo (CCMC) and full configuration interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) calculations. The heat bath sampling of Holmes et al. [Holmes, A. A.; Changlani, H. J.; Umrigar, C. J. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 1561–1571.] dramatically increases the efficiency of the spawn step of such algorithms but requires memory storage scaling quartically with system size which can be prohibitive for large systems. Alternatively, Alavi et al. [Smart, S. D.; Booth, G. H.; Alavi, A. Unpublished results.] approximated these weights with weights based on Cauchy–Schwarz-like inequalities calculated on-the-fly. While reducing the memory cost, this algorithm scales linearly in system size computationally. We combine both of these ideas with the single-reference nature of many systems studied and introduce a spawn-sampling algorithm that has low memory requirements (quadratic in basis set size) compared to the heat bath algorithm and only scales either independently of system size (CCMC) or linearly in the number of electrons (FCIQMC) that works especially well on localized orbitals. Tests on small water chains with localized orbitals with CCMC and with an initiator point sample in FCIQMC indicate that it can be equally efficient as the other excitation generators. As the system gets larger, calculations with our new algorithm converge faster than the on-the-fly weight algorithm while having a much more favorable memory scaling than the heat bath algorithm.},

  abstract = {The multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory is considered the standard starting point for almost all multireference approaches required for strongly correlated molecular problems. The limitation of the approach is generally given by the number of strongly correlated orbitals in the molecule, since its cost will grow exponentially with this number. We present a new multiconfigurational self-consistent field approach, wherein linear determinant coefficients of a multiconfigurational wave function are optimized via the stochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo technique at greatly reduced computational cost, with nonlinear orbital rotation parameters updated variationally based on this sampled wave function. This extends this approach to strongly correlated systems with far larger active spaces than it is possible to treat via conventional means. By comparison with this traditional approach, we demonstrate that the introduction of stochastic noise in both the determinant amplitudes and the gradient and Hessian of the orbital rotations does not preclude robust and reliable convergence of the orbital optimization. It can even improve the ability to avoid convergence to local minima in the orbital space, and therefore aid in finding variationally lower-energy solutions. We consider the effect on the convergence of the orbitals as the number of walkers and the sampling time within the active space increases, as well as the effect on the final energy and error. The scope of the new protocol is demonstrated with a study of the increasingly strongly correlated electronic structure in a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to the large coronene molecule in a complete active space of 24 π electrons in 24 orbitals, requiring only modest computational resources.},

  abstract = {Stochastic-CASSCF and DMRG procedures have been utilized to quantify the role of the electron-correlation mechanisms that, in an Fe-porphyrin model system, are responsible for the differential stabilization of the 3Eg over the 5A1g state. Orbital entanglement diagrams and CI coefficients of the wave function in a localized orbital basis allow for an effective interpretation of the role of charge-transfer configurations. A preliminary version of the Stochastic Generalized Active Space Self-Consistent Field method has been developed and is here introduced to further assess the π backdonation stabilizing effect. By the new method, excitations between metal and ligand orbitals can selectively be removed from the complete CI expansion. It is demonstrated that these excitations are key to the differential stabilization of the triplet, effectively leading to a quantitative measure of the correlation-enhanced π backdonation.},

  abstract = {Full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo ({FCIQMC}) is a stochastic approach for finding the ground state of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian. It is based on the dynamical evolution of a walker population in Hilbert space, which samples the ground state configuration vector over many iterations. Here, we present a modification of the original protocol for walker population control of Booth et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 131, 054106 (2009)] in order to achieve equilibration at a pre-defined average walker number and to avoid walker number overshoots. The dynamics of the walker population is described by a noisy damped harmonic oscillator and controlled by two parameters responsible for damping and forcing, respectively, for which reasonable values are suggested. We further introduce a population growth witness that can be used to detect annihilation plateaus related to overcoming the {FCIQMC} sign problem. Features of the new population control procedure such as precise walker number control and fast equilibration are demonstrated. The standard error of the shift estimator for the ground state energy as well as the population control bias is found to be unaffected by the population control procedure or its parameters. The improved control of the walker number, and thereby memory consumption, is a desirable feature required for automating {FCIQMC} calculations and requires minimal modifications to the existing code.},
