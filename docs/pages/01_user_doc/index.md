# Using NECI

Here you will find instructions on how to use NECI for FCIQMC calculations. We start with installation instructions, then give a quick overview in the form of a simple tutorial, and then dive into more detail on the individual keywords and capabilities of NECI. See the sidebar (if on the website) for navigation between sections.

If you use NECI, please be sure to cite Ref [@Guther2020].
