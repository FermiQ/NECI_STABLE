## Additional Reading with Technical Details

A list of references can be found in the [references section](08_references.html). Here we simply point to some of them of which may be of interest to the reader.

- The original FCIQMC method is in Ref [@Booth2009].

- Quite a bit of symmetries and some details on the initiator method that is actually implemented is in Ref [@Booth2011].

- Linear scaling algorithm, (uniform) excitation generation and overall
algorithm of FCIQMC is in Ref [@Booth2014].

- Density matrices, real walker weights and sampling bias is in Ref [@Overy2014].

- The KP-FCIQMC method is in Ref [@Blunt2015].

- Error (blocking) analysis is described in Ref [@Flyvbjerg1989].
