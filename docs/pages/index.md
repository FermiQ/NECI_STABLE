title: Documentation
---

Here you can find the documentation files converted by pandoc and then made prettier "by hand." To view them as PDFs,
see [here for the user doc](../../../pdf/neci_user.pdf) and [here for the developer doc](../../../pdf/neci_dev.pdf).

@todo
So far this is just some preliminary work I did with pandoc to convert the pdf documents to latex. I couldn't get this to work as nicely as I had hoped, so I started doing it manually. Unfortunately, this is a rather arduous endeavour so I stopped for now, hence the documentation here is neither complete nor pretty.

@todo
Probably worth mentioning where NECI is used as an interface (Molpro, I think pySCF), I don't know if there is some kind of tutorial.
