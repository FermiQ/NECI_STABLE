do a profiling analysis of my guga code: 

calcb_vector_int seems to use a lot of cpu power...
but is this because of debug? 

yes it is. cont. on profiling with new results: 

removed allocs in init_csf_information

also decode_bit det is called more often than necessary, if i would just reuse nI info more often..

in the cum_list creation, i should remove the calls to get_umat_el, if i dont use integral influence at all
should just create a cum_list once, (of the non-double orbitals) and store that and reuse it.. 

or I have to think how to use the integral influence to improve the pgens..

do a long profiling run now, to see where the bottle necks in long calculations are!

init_csf_info is a big bottle neck.. i probably should think about how to improve that piece of code.. 

also the binary search in the off-diagonal matrix element calculation.. 
this i could optimize for parallel atleast, if i only store the relevant CSFs on each core and not the whole list 
calcremaingswitches also is a bitch, which is called in checkcompatibility.. maybe there is also a way to optimize that

for csf_info, a bitwise decoder would be possible i guess.. but probably simon would be the expert to ask for that.. 
lets skype with him in the near future.. 

but not much to improve anymore i guess. 

test if everything still works fine with the changes made!
