do a profiling analysis of my guga code: 

calcb_vector_int seems to use a lot of cpu power...
but is this because of debug? 

yes it is. cont. on profiling with new results: 

removed allocs in init_csf_information

also decode_bit det is called more often than necessary, if i would just reuse nI info more often..

in the cum_list creation, i should remove the calls to get_umat_el, if i dont use integral influence at all
should just create a cum_list once, (of the non-double orbitals) and store that and reuse it.. 

or I have to think how to use the integral influence to improve the pgens..
