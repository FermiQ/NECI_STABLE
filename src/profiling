do a profiling analysis of my guga code: 

calcb_vector_int seems to use a lot of cpu power...
but is this because of debug? 

yes it is. cont. on profiling with new results: 

removed allocs in init_csf_information

also decode_bit det is called more often than necessary, if i would just reuse nI info more often..
