Usage:

neci.x inputfile > outputfile
OR
neci.x < inputfile > outputfile
(I prefer neci.x inputfile | tee outputfile if run interactively)
[or just neci.x inputfile > outputfile]

The input file is keyword driven and requires the minimal amount of information.  Some flags can only be used for certain calculations (or rather, are irrelevant for othert types of runs).  The order of input blocks is not important, nor is the order within a block, unless an option is only valid when a logical statement is true, in which case the relevant keyword for the logical statement must precede its related keywords.  I have imposed a block structure on the input file to aid readability.

General points to note:
* Parameters which follow a keyword ought to be on the same line as the keyword,but this isn't a strict requirement.
* A new line is required for each keyword, unless the keyword is an option of another keyword, in which case it ought to be on the same line.
* Blank lines are ignored.
* Comments are enclosed in brackets.
* Data items are terminated by space or comma.
* The input file is not case sensitive.
* Only the variables relevant to the desired run are required.
* Unknown keywords return an error message and stop the run.
* It is trivial to change the keyword or which block it's in.  Similarly, if it would be better to set some variables to be true by default, then it's easy to add to the routine such that it's possible to turn those options off as desired.
* Sensible defaults need to be set - this will reduce the amount of information currently required from the input file.

Keywords

Syntax:  Keywords are specified by capitals.  Options/data required after a keyword are in <angled brackets>.  Alternative options are separated by commas.

TITLE 
    Takes the rest of the line as the title and passes it to output.

SYSTEM <system type> [required]
    Starts system block.
    System types are:
                    READ,GENERIC
                    DFREAD
                    BOX
                    HUBBARD
                    UEG
                    CPMD
One of these must be specified.  If READ or GENERIC is followed by ORDER, then a quick HF calculation is performed to give an ordering of the orbitals read in (THFORDER = .true.).  If CPMD is followed by ORDER, then the CPMD orbitals are ordered, not according to their CPMD eigenvalues, but instead according to their one-electron energies (i.e. with no exchange or correlation). 
   DFREAD reads in a set of density fitted coefficients and coulomb integrals from files SAV_DFaSOL and SAV_Ta_INT.  One-electron integrals are read in from XXX. 

ELECTRONS,NEL <NEL> [required]

SPIN-RESTRICT <LMS> [default off.  default LMS=0]
    Turns spin restriction on, limiting the working space to the z-component of spin being LMS*2
    
CSF <STOT> [default off.  default STOT=0]
    If specified, work in CSFs rather than determinants.  CSFs might not function properly for some monte carlo, but should work for vertex sums and diagonalization.   STOT is twice the magnitude of spin to restrict the resultant space

SYM <SYM(I), I=1,3> <SYM(5)> [default off.  default SYM=(0,0,0,,0)]
   If specified, limit the working space to space with the specified symmetry quantum numbers.
   The final quantum number corresponds to the irrep symmetry.  If working in an Abelian group, this symmetry achieved is 2**SYM(5), which 
     corresponds to irrep SYM(5)+1.  SYM(5)=0 corresponds to the totally symmetric rep. This will not function without Abelian (1D) symmetry. 

CELL <NMAXX NMAXY NMAXZ> [required for HUBBARD, UEG, and BOX]
   Maximum basis functions for each dimension.  For HUBBARD and UEG, functions range from -NMAX to NMAX, but for BOX, they range from 1 to NMAX

MESH <NMSH> [default 32]
   Number of mesh points for integrals for BOX

BOXSIZE <BOX [BOA COA]> [BOX required for UEG, and BOX.  BOA, COA optional, default 1]
    Set lattice vector a, b and c, where b and c are defined as a ratio of a.

U <UHUB> [only needed for HUBBARD.  default=0]
B <BHUB> [only needed for HUBBARD.  default=0]
    Sets U (on-site repulsion) and B (hopping or kinetic energy) parameters for the Hubbard model.

COULOMB <FCOUL>
      Multiplies the strength of the coulomb interaction by FCOUL

COULOMB-DAMPING ENERGY <FCOULDAMPMU FCOULDAMPBETA>
COULOMB-DAMPING ORBITAL <COULDAMPORB FCOULDAMPBETA>
      Damps the two-electron coulomb integrals, <a b || c d> with factor f(Ea)f(Eb)f(Ec)f(Ed)
      where f(E)=ERFC(BETA*(E-MU)).  Beta of 1 gives a damping range of 2.  Beta of 40 gives a damping range of 0.05
      ENERGY sets the MU manually.  ORBITAL sets MU half way between the energies of ORB and ORB+1
COULOMB-DAMPING is now disabled [26/7/06]


REAL        [HUBBARD ONLY}
APERIODIC   {HUBBARD ONLY]
    Hubbard model is set to be real space and/or not periodic.

TILT <ITILTX ITILTY> [HUBBARD only.  default off]
    System is tilted (Hubbard only?) and the unit vectors are (x,y)=(ITILTX,ITILTY) and (-y,x).  Requirement that x>= y.

ALPHA <ALPHA>
    Sets TALPHA=.true. and defines ALPHA.

ENDSYS
    End system block.

CALC
    Start calculation block.  This chooses what calculation to do.

HAMILTONIAN
    Store the Hamiltonian.  This is defaulted to ON if ENERGY is set, but can be used without ENERGY.

EXCITE <ICILEVEL> [default=0]
   Excitiation level at which to truncate determinant list.  If ICILEVEL=0 then all determinants are enumerated.

ENERGY
    Calculate the energy by diagonalising.  Requires that one of COMPLETE, LANCZOS, or READ be set.

COMPLETE
    Do a full diagonalisation working out all eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  if HAMILTONIAN is OFF, this throws away the eigenvectors and eigenvalues after having used them for calculation.  Relevant parameters are HAMILTONIAN and BLOCK

BLOCK <ON,OFF>
    Determines whether the Hamiltonian is calculated for each block or not.  This only works for COMPLETE 

READ
    Read in eigenvectors and eigenvalues from a previous calculation.

LANCZOS
    Do a Lanczos block diagonalisation.  The relevant parameters are BLOCKS, KRYLOV, ACCURACY, STEPS, EIGENVALUES

EIGENVALUES <NEVAL>
    Required number of eigenvalues.

BLOCKS <NBLK>
    Set number of blocks in Lanczos routine.

KRYLOV <NKRY>

TIMESTEPS <I_P>
   Set p, the timesteps into which exp(- Beta H) is split.  Automatically sets BETA/P=0 (as required) but returns an error message if BETA/P is also set.

DELTABETA <DBETA>
   Set delta_beta.  If a negative value, calculates exactly.

RHOEPSILON <RHOEPSILON>
   Set the minimum significant value of RHO (as a fraction of RHOIIMAX).

EXCITATIONS OLD,NEW
   For generation of up to double excitations use the old (completely reliable), or new
   (faster, but does not work for more than 2-vertex level SUMS) routine

METHODS
   Begin a METHODS BLOCK.  This allows a different method for each vertex level.
   Each vertex level can contain EXCITATIONS, VERTICES and CYCLES keywords
   The block terminates with ENDMETHODS
   e.g.

      METHODS
         METHOD VERTEX SUM NEW
         EXCITATIONS DOUBLES
         METHOD VERTEX STAR POLY
         EXCITATIONS SINGLES
         VERTICES 2
      ENDMETHODS

   Sets the first method, at a two-vertex level, to be a complete 2-vertex sum of only doubles,
     and the second method, overriden to be also at  the two-vertex level, to be a vertex star 
      of singles.

VERTICES
   Only usable in a methods block.  By default, each method takes a number of vertices corresponding to its
     index within the methods block, the first methods corresponding to the 2-vertex level, the second to the 
     3-vertex level etc. .  VERTICES overrides this, and allows you to specify the vertex level of each method, 
     allowing, for example, to split the 2-vertex level into doubles and singles which are handled separately.

ENDMETHODS
   Terminate a methods block

EXCITATIONS SINGLES,DOUBLES
   Limits excitations in METHOD VERTEX SUM NEW to only singles or doubles.

METHOD <METHOD>

    VERTEX STAR DIAG,POLY
        Constructs a star from all determinants connected to the root (ignoring connections between those dets).
        DIAG does a complete diagonalization on the resultant matrix.  This can be very slow.
        POLY uses the special properties of the matrix to find the roots of the polynomial and uses them to calculat
               the relevant values.
        The excitation routine specified in EXCITATIONS OLD,NEW is used.

    Choose the first NPATHS determinants and calculate RHOPII etc.

ALLPATHS
    Choose all determinants (i.e. set NPATHS = -1).
