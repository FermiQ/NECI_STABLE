NNR:		NMSH**3
ALAT(3): 	X,Y,Z dim of box
LEN:    	# of possible basis fn spinorbitals from basis set
G1(4,LEN): 	I,J,K,L of each basis fn,IG
ARR(LEN): 	energy of each basis fn -| sorted in order of energy
BRR(LEN):       IG of basis fn          -| (BRR was a REAL now an INTEGER)
                  so BRR(1) gives the index in G1 of the lowest energy
                  basis fn
NHG:    	= LEN
NDET:   	# Slater determinants possible from basis fns
	(From 212) = II
II:		# Slater determinants we are using with given constraints
NMRKS(NEL,II):	The IG of the basis fn for that electron within a det.
NROW(NDET):	# non-zero elements in each row of H
GC:		Total # non-zero elements in H
LAB(GC):	The column index of each element of HAMIL
ICMAX:		Max # of non-zero elements in row of H
LENHAMIL:	=GC
W(NEVAL):        Energies of the eigenfunctions of H
CK(NDET,NEVAL):  The eigenfunctions of H
